        <h1>Section One</h1>
        <p>Nature is the most beautiful and attractive surrounding around us which make us happy and provide us natural
            environment to live healthy. Our nature provides us variety of beautiful flowers, attractive birds, animals,
            green plants, blue sky, land, running rivers, sea, forests, air, mountains, valleys, hills and many more
            things. Our God has created a beautiful nature for the healthy living of us. All the things we use for our
            living are the assets of nature which we should not spoil and damage.
            We should not destroy the originality of the nature and should not imbalance the ecosystem cycle. Our nature
            provides us beautiful environment to live and enjoy so it is our responsibility to keep it clean and away
            from all the damages. In the modern era, many selfish and bad activities of the human being have disturbed
            the nature to a great extent. But we all should try to maintain our natureâ€™s beauty.The nature is everything
            around us which surrounds us with beautiful environment. We see and enjoy it every moment. We observe
            natural changes in it, hear it and feel it everywhere. We should take full advantage of the nature and go
            out of home for the morning walk daily to breathe pure air and enjoy morning beauty of nature. All though
            the day it changes it beauty like in the morning when sun rises everything looks bright orange and then
            yellowish. In the evening when sun sets it again becomes dark orange and then light dark. </p>

        <h1>Section Two</h1>
        <p>Everything in the nature has their own power and uniqueness provided by the God. It has its many forms
            which are changing by season to season and even from minute to minute such as sea looks bright blue in
            the morning but by noon it looks emerald green colour. Sky changes its colour all through the day from
            pale pink at sunrise, dazzling blue in late morning, bright orange in evening at sunset and purple by
            twilight. Our mood also gets changed according to the nature such as happy and hopeful at sun shine,
            rainy season and spring season. We feel heartily happy at moonlight and little bored and tired in high
            sun light. Nature has some powerful transformative power which changes our mood and behaviour accordingly.
            Nature has power to recover the patients from their diseases if they are provided with the required and
            pleasant environment. Nature is very essential for our healthy life so we should keep it clean and conserve
            it for our future generations. We should cut trees and forests, should not despoil the ocean, rivers, should
            not make hole in ozone layer, should not increase green house effect, global warming and many more through
            our selfish activities. We should get fully aware about our nature and try our best to keep it natural so
            that it can nourish life on the earth forever.</p>

        <h1>Section Three</h1>
        <p>Now a day, everyone has less time to enjoy nature. In the increasing crowd we forgot to enjoy nature and
            improve health. We started using technological instruments for our health fitness. However it is very true
            that nature has power to nourish us and fit us forever. Most of the writers have described the real beauty
            and advantage of the nature in their writings. Nature has ability to make our mind tension free and cure our
            diseases. Because of technological advancement in the life of human being, our nature is declining gradually
            which needs a high level of awareness to keep it in balance and to conserve natural assets.
            God has created everything very beautifully seeing which our eyes can never be tired. But we forgot that we
            too have some responsibility towards our nature to relationship between nature and human beings. How
            beautiful scenery it looks in morning with sunrise, songs of birds, sounds of lakes, rivers, air and happy
            gatherings of friends in the evening in garden after a long day of crush. But we forgot to enjoy the beauty
            of the nature in just fulfilling our duties towards our families. </p>
